## What is YAML?

YAML, which stands for Yet Another Markup Language, or YAML Ain’t Markup Language (depending who you ask) is a human-readable text-based format for specifying configuration-type information

### History and name

YAML (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with camel[2]) was first proposed by Clark Evans in 2001, who designed it together with Ingy döt Net and Oren Ben-Kiki. 

Originally YAML was said to mean Yet Another Markup Language, referencing its purpose as a markup language with the yet another construct, but it 
was then repurposed as YAML Ain't Markup Language, a recursive acronym, to distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup.


### YAML & JSON

YAML is a superset of JSON, which means that any valid JSON file is also a valid YAML file.
